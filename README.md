## Dependency
To generate the figures of the paper we used the [seaborn library](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) that you need to install on your system  as well if you want to re-generate them.

## Ipython notebook tutorial

How to use this code is explained in this [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html):
