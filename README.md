# Turn-taking model

This repository contains the source code related to the paper we recently submitted at the ICDL-Epirob 2015 conference. 

## Dependency
To generate the figures of the paper we used the [seaborn library](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) that you need to install on your system  as well if you want to re-generate them.

We also use one function from the [sklearn library](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) that you need to install too.

## Ipython notebook tutorial

How to use this code is explained in this [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html):

[Autonomous development of turn-taking behaviors in agent populations: a computational study,](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/clement-moulin-frier/turntaking_model/blob/master/turn_taking.ipynb)

that you can either read by clicking on the above link, or run interactively by installing [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), cloning our repository and:

    cd local/path/to/the/repo
    ipython notebook
